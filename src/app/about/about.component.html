  </p>
  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We recommend that you have a strong and stable internet
      connection, when participating in WhatsPool, since your chance
      of being a winner, greatly hinges on how fast, you're able to
      fetch and answer the questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      On login, each user has a one (1) hour login session, before
      they're logged out automatically by the system. This is a
      security measure, to prevent an unauthorized user from accessing
      your account while you're away from your device.
      <p>
        So, in order to avoid being logged out while the game is on,
        ensure you log in few minutes to the game time (e.g 8:50 P.M).
        This would give you enough time to participate in the game,
        without being automatically logged out by the system after one
        (1) hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above stated scenario is different from the scenario where
        the game time is up, while a participant hasn't finished. Once
        the game time (10 minutes) is up, a participant would be
        unable to provide further answers and the game ends
        automatically.
      </p>
